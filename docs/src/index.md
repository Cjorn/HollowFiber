# Luna Documentation
This is the documentation for [Luna](https://github.com/LupoLab/Luna). The [README](https://github.com/LupoLab/Luna/blob/master/README.md) contains installation and quickstart instructions. This documentation is intended to lay out the physical model used give deeper insight into the workings of Luna. It is not yet complete--any contributions are welcome!

If you are new to Luna, the most interesting page is probably [the simple interface](#The-simple-interface). Details about the actual equation Luna solves can be found in [the numerical model](#The-numerical-model) section.
